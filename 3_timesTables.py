#Using a for loop to display Times Tables

#Predict: What does the 4 and the 3 "do"?
for i in range(4):
    print(i, "x", 3, " = ", i*3)

#Run the programme

#Investigate: Were you correct with your prediction?

#Modify the code: change the numbers 4 and 3 to see what happens

#Make a new programme:
#Ask the user to input what times tables they want?
